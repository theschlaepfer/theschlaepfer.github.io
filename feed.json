Probably because I'm a dad now. I do think it's let down by the score a bit. It goes a bit too \"generic fantasy\" for me. I was thinking about how the How to Train Your Dragon soundtrack just completely elevates that movie. This one is relatively unmemorable, and I think actively detracts from some segments.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/film/onward-2020/1/\">View on Letterboxd ‚Üí</a></p>\n",
